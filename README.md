# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis Case Study

## 📘 Overview
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, emerged in late 2019 and rapidly spread across the globe, resulting in profound health, economic, and social consequences.  
This project highlights the crucial role of **data analysis** in understanding and managing pandemics by examining patterns in confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths.

Through this case study, we apply Python-based data analysis techniques to gain insights into the spread and impact of COVID-19 worldwide, enabling data-driven decision-making and better resource allocation.

## 📊 Dataset Details
This project uses three open-source datasets containing **daily cumulative COVID-19 statistics** across multiple countries and regions (January 22, 2020 – May 29, 2021):

1. **Confirmed Cases Dataset** – Total confirmed cases per day per country.  
2. **Deaths Dataset** – Cumulative number of deaths attributed to COVID-19.  
3. **Recovered Cases Dataset** – Total number of recovered individuals per country.

Each dataset includes:
- `Province/State`, `Country/Region`
- `Lat`, `Long`
- Daily cumulative counts from 2020–2021

## 🎯 Objectives
The primary goals of this analysis are:

1. **Practical Application of Python** – Strengthen skills in data loading, cleaning, manipulation, and visualization.  
2. **Insightful Data Analysis** – Understand COVID-19 spread, mortality, and recovery trends.  
3. **Skill Development** – Work with real-world datasets using:
   - `pandas` for data manipulation  
   - `numpy` for numerical analysis  
   - `matplotlib` for visualization
📊 Key Insights

Global Trend: COVID-19 cases rose exponentially in early 2020 and peaked again in late 2020–early 2021, reflecting major global waves of infection.

Regional Impact: The United States, India, and Brazil recorded the highest cumulative confirmed cases and deaths, indicating prolonged and widespread outbreaks.

Mortality Rates: Italy, the UK, and Brazil exhibited the highest average death rates during 2020, suggesting early healthcare strain and higher disease severity.

Recovery Trends: Countries like Australia and Canada maintained strong recovery rates, with Australia showing more efficient case management and resolution.

Daily Surges: Italy faced the sharpest early surge in daily new cases (March 2020), while Germany’s peaks appeared later but were smaller due to better containment.

Provincial Variation: Within Canada, death rates varied across provinces, with Quebec and Ontario showing higher mortality due to population density and outbreak clusters.

US-Specific Insights: The United States saw two major mortality waves — mid-2020 and early 2021 — followed by improving recovery ratios as vaccination increased.

Global Recovery vs Deaths: Across countries such as South Africa, recoveries consistently outpaced deaths, highlighting improved medical response and adaptation over time.

Monthly Trends: Aggregated monthly data revealed synchronized global peaks in infection and death rates around late 2020, followed by gradual stabilization in 2021.

Technical Insight: The project demonstrates the value of Python-based data cleaning, transformation, and visualization in uncovering real-world health insights from large-scale datasets.
