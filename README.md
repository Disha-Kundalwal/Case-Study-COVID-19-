# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis Case Study

## 📘 Overview
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, emerged in late 2019 and rapidly spread across the globe, resulting in profound health, economic, and social consequences.  
This project highlights the crucial role of **data analysis** in understanding and managing pandemics by examining patterns in confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths.

Through this case study, we apply Python-based data analysis techniques to gain insights into the spread and impact of COVID-19 worldwide, enabling data-driven decision-making and better resource allocation.

## 📊 Dataset Details
This project uses three open-source datasets containing **daily cumulative COVID-19 statistics** across multiple countries and regions (January 22, 2020 – May 29, 2021):

1. **Confirmed Cases Dataset** – Total confirmed cases per day per country.  
2. **Deaths Dataset** – Cumulative number of deaths attributed to COVID-19.  
3. **Recovered Cases Dataset** – Total number of recovered individuals per country.

Each dataset includes:
- `Province/State`, `Country/Region`
- `Lat`, `Long`
- Daily cumulative counts from 2020–2021
