# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis Case Study

## 📘 Overview
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, emerged in late 2019 and rapidly spread across the globe, resulting in profound health, economic, and social consequences.  
This project highlights the crucial role of **data analysis** in understanding and managing pandemics by examining patterns in confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths.

Through this case study, we apply Python-based data analysis techniques to gain insights into the spread and impact of COVID-19 worldwide, enabling data-driven decision-making and better resource allocation.

## 📊 Dataset Details
This project uses three open-source datasets containing **daily cumulative COVID-19 statistics** across multiple countries and regions (January 22, 2020 – May 29, 2021):

1. **Confirmed Cases Dataset** – Total confirmed cases per day per country.  
2. **Deaths Dataset** – Cumulative number of deaths attributed to COVID-19.  
3. **Recovered Cases Dataset** – Total number of recovered individuals per country.

Each dataset includes:
- `Province/State`, `Country/Region`
- `Lat`, `Long`
- Daily cumulative counts from 2020–2021

## 🎯 Objectives
The primary goals of this analysis are:

1. **Practical Application of Python** – Strengthen skills in data loading, cleaning, manipulation, and visualization.  
2. **Insightful Data Analysis** – Understand COVID-19 spread, mortality, and recovery trends.  
3. **Skill Development** – Work with real-world datasets using:
   - `pandas` for data manipulation  
   - `numpy` for numerical analysis  
   - `matplotlib` for visualization

## 📊 Key Insights

COVID-19 cases rose sharply in early 2020, with major global peaks in late 2020 and early 2021.

The US, India, and Brazil had the highest confirmed cases and deaths.

Italy, the UK, and Brazil showed the highest death rates in 2020.

Australia had better recovery outcomes compared to Canada.

Italy faced the earliest and highest single-day surge in Europe.

In Canada, provinces like Quebec and Ontario saw higher death rates.

The US experienced two major waves, with improved recovery after vaccination began.

South Africa showed high recovery rates and lower mortality overall.

Monthly data revealed synchronized global peaks and later stabilization.

Demonstrates how Python-based data analysis reveals real-world health insights.
